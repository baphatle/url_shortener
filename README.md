**URL Shortener**

**Overview**

The URL Shortener is a simple and efficient web app that lets users convert long URLs into shorter, shareable links. It also provides a redirect service to direct users from the short link to the original URL.

Unlike other shorteners, this app offers added security with password protection, URL expiration, and custom short codes, giving users more control over their links.

**Why These Technologies?**

I chose **ReactJS**, **ExpressJS**, and **MongoDB** because they provide a modern, scalable, and efficient stack. ReactJS allows us to build responsive and dynamic user interfaces, ExpressJS is a fast and lightweight backend framework, and MongoDB offers flexible, document-based storage that handles the dynamic data requirements of this URL shortener efficiently.

**Completed Features**

**Core Features:**

- **Original URL Input Form**: Users can submit a long URL that they wish to shorten.
- **Shortened URL Display**: After submitting, users receive a shortened URL.
- **Copy Short URL Button**: A convenient button to copy the shortened URL to the clipboard.

**Optional Features:**

- **Password Protection**: Users can set a password for specific shortened URLs to restrict access.
- **URL Expiry Date**: Users can specify an expiration date for the shortened URLs, allowing them to self-expire after a set period.
- **Custom Short Codes**: Users can create their own custom short codes for their URLs instead of using auto-generated ones.

   `    `"expiresAt": "2024-10-25T12:48:07.297Z"

   }

## **Known Issues and Fixes**
- **URL Formatting Error**: If the original URL lacks the protocol (http:// or https://), the browser treats it as a relative path, causing redirection errors (e.g., localhost:6061/youtube.com). This was fixed by ensuring the system automatically adds the correct protocol if it's missing.
- **Expiration Date Miscalculation**: An error occurred when the expiration date was calculated using a string instead of a number. This led to incorrect dates (e.g., jumping to the year 2025). The issue was resolved by ensuring the correct data type (number) is passed to the server.

## **Future Improvements**
- **User Account Registration and Login**: Allow users to register and log in to manage their own shortened URLs.
- **Short URL Management**: Users can:
  - View all URLs theyâ€™ve created (including Original URL, Short URL, Password, Expiration Date, and access statistics).
  - Extend the expiration date for their URLs.
  - Delete any of their created short URLs.
